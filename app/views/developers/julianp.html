Hello, I am Julian Poyourow, and I created Kondeo.<br /><br />
I have been working with electricity for a long time. It all started at about age 4 when I took apart the light switch on my bedroom wall with a screwdriver I found. Although the move worried my parents somewhat, they started me on taking things apart. I began disassembling electronics such as VCRs and tape recorders.<br /><br />
Electronics have fascinated me since that time. I was given my first computer at age 8, and I loved it. I would spend my time working on the settings and changing things to perfect my experience.<br /><br />
Over time, I got better and better at working on computers and started my own business, PoyourowIT. Through PoyourowIT, I worked on client’s computers, fixing issues including software and hardware. Over time, I learned more and more about computers. As the business flourished in my hometown Westchester, California, I began to desire more from my work with computers.<br /><br />
It wasn’t boredom. It was simply a wish to have more control over the computer and what it was doing. I decided that I would try computer programming. I started working on and building websites. I studied with main programmer James Hatton of Dictionary.com. He instructed me in HTML and CSS, as well as Javascript.<br /><br />
As of now, I oversee the development and maintenance of TreeMusketeers.org, a website for a nonprofit of El Segundo, California. I still run PoyourowIT with a growing database of clients. I manage all of the computers and networking for The Good Pizza and all of their business locations.<br /><br />
I have taken several classes, in a diverse range of programming languages. I am qualified in PHP, Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I have been qualified in work on the Android operating system. I have also studied SQL database organization and design.<br /><br />
At Kondeo I assemble all of this history and expertise, as well as the experience of my team, to create amazing new software and hardware.
